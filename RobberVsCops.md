# Robber Locating Game
## Locating a backtracking robber on a tree
_2014; Seager_
_1 cop, backtracking/non-backtracking_

1. Backtracking vs non-backtracking: can or cannot move to the probe vertex
   _ non_backtracking locatable graphs: $K_3$, $K_{2,3}$, trees, ...
   _ Below all consider backtracking robbers
3. _hideout_: a subgraph that the robber can win by remaining in it; several hideout graphs examples
4. Subdivision; also related to capture time(!)
5. Trees: "The cop wins on a tree T if and only if T does not contain a copy of $T_{3,3}$"

Comments:
- One useful tool: _extended robber set_ - possible robber location for the cop just before cop probes

## Locating a robber with multiple probes

# Hunter versus Robber
_the hunter aims to catch a randomly-moving target; the rabbit's strategy is unrestricted_

# Cop versus Gambler
_the cop aims to catch a randomly-moving target; the gambler follows a probability distribution on the vertices and its location at different timestamps are independent_
